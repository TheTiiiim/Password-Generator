# Password-Generator

This repository is my submission to UNH Coding Bootcamp's third homework assignment, where we were tasked to make a password generator.

I started with creating the `generatePassword` function with options for length, and booleans for types of characters to use.
I then made a simple webpage with a form for options and a destination for the result.

To generate the password I attached a form validation function to the submit button and assuming all goes well, your password will appear under the `Result`, any input issues will be reported in the result space. 

The deployed project can be found [here](https://thetiiiim.github.io/Password-Generator/Index.html)
